| [BehaviorComponent](xref:Anki.Vector.BehaviorComponent)   | Complex tasks which require Vector's internal logic to complete |
| [CameraComponent](xref:Anki.Vector.BehaviorComponent)     | Support for Vector's camera feed |
| [ControlComponent](xref:Anki.Vector.ControlComponent)     | Manage control of Vector's behaviors |
| [EventComponent](xref:Anki.Vector.EventComponent)         | Subscribe to events generated directly by Vector |
| [FaceComponent](xref:Anki.Vector.FaceComponent)           | Manage faces stored on the robot |
| [MotorComponent](xref:Anki.Vector.MotorComponent)         | Control the low-level motor functions |

In addition this namespace contains the [Authentication](xref:Anki.Vector.Authentication) class for logging into Vector
and creating [RobotConfiguration](xref:Anki.Vector.RobotConfiguration) instances for connecting to a Vector robot.

### Anki.Vector.Events

This namespace that contains all the *EventArgs* types for all the events generated by the SDK.  This includes events generated directly by the robot ([RobotEventArgs](xref:Anki.Vector.Events.RobotEventArgs)) and events generated by the 
main Robot class and various other components.

### Anki.Vector.Exceptions

This namespace contains the exceptions generated by the SDK.  They all inherit from [VectorException](xref:Anki.Vector.Exceptions.VectorException).

### Anki.Vector.Objects

This namespace contains the types for the various supported objects that Vector can recognize including his charger, light cube, faces, and custom objects.

| Object Type                                               | Description                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
